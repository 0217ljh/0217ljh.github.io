I am a master's student in the Optics program at the [School of Physics](https://spe.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), where I have been enrolled since 2022 and am set to graduate in 2025, under the guidance of [Prof. Xiangyang Yu](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7404115750).
<br/><br/>
My research is centered on AI4Science, particularly the use of large-scale language modeling in the natural sciences.
<br/><br/>
At present, we are working on "Innovative Spectral (Physical) Analysis Methods Using Large Language Models (LLMs)," which represents a groundbreaking field of spectral research that integrates numerous interdisciplinary aspects from computer science.
