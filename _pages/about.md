I am a master's student in the Optics program at the School of Physics, Sun Yat-sen University, where I have been enrolled since 2022 and am set to graduate in 2025, under the guidance of Prof. Xiangyang Yu.
<br/><br/>
My research is centered on AI4Science, particularly the use of large-scale language modeling in the natural sciences. 
<br/><br/>
At present, we are working on "Innovative Spectral (Physical) Analysis Methods Using Large Language Models (LLMs)," which represents a groundbreaking field of spectral research that integrates numerous interdisciplinary aspects from computer science.
