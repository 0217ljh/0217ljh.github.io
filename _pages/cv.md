Research Experience
======
* **Multimodal Infrared Spectra Analysis through the Integration of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model Encoding**
  * Apr, 2024 - Present
  * Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China
  * Advisor: Xiangyang Yu, Ziru Yu
  * We used knowledge graphs to combine spectral experimental data from sample with information from text, graphics and other modalities, and semantically encoded them through LLM to achieve a multi-modal approach to credible spectral analysis
  * **Personal contribution**：Refinement of research ideas, Construction of knowledge graphs, Design of experimental code
  * **Paper (expected)**: "Enhanced Multimodal Infrared Spectra Analysis through the Integration of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model Encoding"

&nbsp;

* **Spectral Knowledge Q&A System Based on Large Models**
  * Sep, 2023 - Jun, 2024
  * Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China
  * Advisor: Xiangyang Yu, Ziru Yu
  * We collected papers related to spectral detection from 2014-2024. Through information extraction, the papers were converted into specific labels to provide knowledge for LLM as well as to serve as data source for Retrieval Augmented Generation
  * **Personal contribution:** Refinement of research ideas, Data collection and annotation from theses, Design and implementation of experimental code, Thesis writing
  * **Paper (expected):** “Quick, trustworthy spectral detection Q&A system based on structured professional literature and driven by Large Language Model”

&nbsp;

* **Water quality detection based on Ultraviolet and Near-infrared (UV-NIR) spectroscopy**
  * Sep, 2022 - Aug, 2023
  * Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China
  * Advisor: Xiangyang Yu
  * In this project, we acquired water sample data through UV-NIR spectroscopy and used machine learning models and LLM to predict feature indicators
  * **Personal contribution**: Refinement of research ideas, Collection and analysis of spectral data from water samples, Employing LLM to predict indicators from sample spectrum yields the most optimal outcome, Thesis writing
  * **Paper:** [Information extraction of UV-NIR spectral data in waste water based on Large Language Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142524006413)
