Research Experience
======
* Research: Multimodal Infrared Spectra Analysis through the Integration of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model Encoding
  * April, 2024 - Present, Sun Yat-sen University
  * Advisor: Xiangyang Yu, Ziru Yu
  * In this project, we used knowledge graphs to combine experimental data from spectral modalities with information from text, graphics and other modalities, and semantically encoded them through macromodels to achieve a multimodal approach to credible spectral analysis.
  * Personal contribution：Research idea refinement, knowledge graph construction, relevant code experimental design
  * Paper(expected): "Enhanced Multimodal Infrared Spectra Analysis through the Integration of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model Encoding"

* Research: Spectral Knowledge Query System Based on Large Models
  * September, 2023 - June, 2024, Sun Yat-sen University
  * Advisor: Xiangyang Yu, Ziru Yu
  * In this project, we collected papers related to spectral detection from 2014-2024. Through information extraction, the papers were converted into specific labels to provide knowledge for a large language model as well as to serve as a data source for fine-tuning.
  * Personal contribution：Research idea refinement,Collect data form thesis, annotate the thesis, design code and related experiments, write the thesis
  * Paper(expected): "Quick, trustworthy spectral detection Q&A based on structured professional literature with Large Language Model fine-tuning"

&nbsp;

* Research: Water quality detection based on ultraviolet-near-infrared spectroscopy
  * September, 2022 - August, 2023, Sun Yat-sen University
  * Advisor: Xiangyang Yu
  * In this project, participants acquired water sample data through UV-NIR spectroscopy and used machine learning models to predict feature indicators.
  * Personal contribution：Research idea refinement, Spectral data of water samples were collected and an innovative use of a grand prognostic model as an alternative tool to a machine learning model was used to predict the spectral data, achieving results that exceeded those of traditional machine learning models. Finally, a related paper is written.
  * Paper: Information extraction of UV-NIR spectral data in waste water based on Large Language Model

&nbsp;

* Research: A study of quantum simulations based on hybrid quantum systems
  * August, 2020 - December, 2021, Sun Yat-sen University
  * Advisor: Zeliang Xiang
  * In the project, the participants designed a novel quantum circuit system that can be used for simulation of spin compression in molecules.
  * Personal contribution：A quantum circuit system was designed for use in the project, and the associated theoretical derivations were also completed.
  * Result: 2020 Innovation Training Programme for Undergraduates (Provincial), Excellent Completion
